# Rock_and_Mine_Prediction

The "Rock_mine_prediction.ipynb" notebook details the process of building a machine learning model to classify objects as either rocks or mines using sonar data. The workflow begins with importing essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, followed by data collection and preprocessing steps, including loading the dataset, exploring its structure, and separating features from labels. The data is then split into training and testing sets, after which a Logistic Regression model is trained. The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy on both the training and test datasets. Finally, the notebook includes a section to make predictions using the trained model, demonstrating the practical application of the predictive system.
